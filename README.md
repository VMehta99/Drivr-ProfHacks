# Drivr

Drivr is a multifunctional hud that displays important data when driving, like the speed limit, swerve data and concentration data which all get collected and parsed onto the screen. This data can be used for insurance companies to find out information about their clientâ€™s speeding trends or reckless driving trends like swerving. The information data is used to prevent car accidents caused by distractions on the road.
